## Current Build State

Last updated: Phase 15 complete (post-CVE-2025-66478 Next.js patch)

### Completed Phases

- Phase 1: Next.js scaffold in /web (layouts, Tailwind, App Router)
- Phase 2: React components from HTML partials
- Phase 3: Cloudflare Worker — 64-route scaffold (deny-by-default)
- Phase 4: Dashboard pages (account, calendar, receipts, support, token-usage)
- Phase 5: Worker auth routes (Google OAuth, magic link, SSO, 2FA)
- Phase 6: Worker Stripe billing (hosted + embedded checkout, webhooks)
- Phase 7: Worker Cal.com (OAuth, bookings, profiles, webhook)
- Phase 8: D1 migrations (15 files — NOTE: VLP has a duplicate 0002_ prefix and no 0014_*.sql; use clean sequential numbering in TMP/TTMP/TTTMP repos)
- Phase 9: Frontend wired to live Worker (HttpOnly cookie session)
- Phase 10: Deployed — virtuallaunch.pro live on Cloudflare Pages
- Phase 11: All 64 Worker routes implemented (zero stubs)
- Phase 12: Sign-in page (magic link + Google OAuth + verify flow)
- Phase 13: Auth guard on dashboard routes
- Phase 14: Marketing pages (about, pricing, features, how-it-works, contact)
- Phase 15: Next.js security patch (CVE-2025-66478)

### Stack

```
Frontend:  Next.js 15 + Tailwind + @cloudflare/next-on-pages
Backend:   Cloudflare Worker (workers/src/index.js)
Database:  Cloudflare D1 (binding: DB)
Storage:   Cloudflare R2 (binding: R2_VIRTUAL_LAUNCH)
Auth:      HttpOnly cookie (vlp_session), Google OAuth, Magic Link, SSO
Billing:   Stripe (hosted + embedded checkout)
Booking:   Cal.com OAuth + webhook
Deploy:    Cloudflare Pages (frontend) + wrangler deploy (Worker)
```

### Key Files

```
/web/lib/api/client.ts         — API client (mock + real)
/web/lib/auth/session.ts       — getSession() + getSessionToken()
/workers/src/index.js          — full Worker (64 routes)
/workers/migrations/           — 15 D1 migration files
/contracts/                    — 64 canonical contracts (do not modify)
/wrangler.toml                 — Worker config, bindings, env vars
```

### Architecture Rules (never violate)

```
1. Contracts are authoritative — never modify without explicit instruction
2. Write pipeline: receipt R2 → canonical R2 → D1
3. VLP owns all shared operational records
4. Worker CORS locked to https://virtuallaunch.pro
5. Session via vlp_session HttpOnly cookie only
6. All billing writes go through VLP Worker routes
7. Frontend pages must submit exactly what the contract expects — no invented fields
```

## Architecture and Write Pipeline

The system runs on Cloudflare edge infrastructure.

Core principles: canonical storage in R2, contract-driven validation, deny-by-default routing, stateless workers.

### Write Pipeline (never deviate)

```
1. Request received
2. Contract validation (reject if invalid — deny-by-default)
3. Receipt written to R2 (immutable event record)
4. Canonical R2 object updated
5. D1 index updated (projection only — never source of truth)
6. Response returned
```

R2 is always authoritative. D1 is always a projection.

### Contract Structure (every contract must have all 7 keys)

```json
{
  "auth": {},
  "contract": {},
  "delivery": {},
  "effects": {},
  "payload": {},
  "response": {},
  "schema": {}
}
```

### Contract Rules

- Contracts are repo-local — never copy a VLP contract into TMP, TTMP, or TTTMP
- Every contract must be versioned: `/contracts/account.create.v1.json`
- Frontend pages must submit exactly what the contract expects — no invented fields
- TMP, TTMP, and TTTMP must NOT have contracts for: billing_customers, billing_invoices, billing_payment_intents, billing_payment_methods, billing_setup_intents, billing_subscriptions, bookings, memberships, professionals, profiles, support_tickets, tokens — those are governed by VLP contracts

---

## Platform Responsibilities

### Ownership Rule

VLP owns all shared operational records across the ecosystem. TMP, TTMP, and TTTMP may READ shared records and project them into their own UX. They must NOT write to shared records directly. Shared writes go through VLP API routes.

---

### Virtual Launch Pro (VLP)

VLP is the professional infrastructure platform and canonical owner of shared operational records.

Responsibilities: account management, billing configuration, booking infrastructure, checkout orchestration, customer portal sessions, membership management, professional dashboard, professional profiles, Stripe customer and subscription lifecycle, support tickets, token balances, token purchase orchestration, webhook-driven billing reconciliation.

Canonical storage (VLP-owned):

```
/r2/accounts_tmp/{account_tmp_id}.json
/r2/accounts_ttmp/{account_ttmp_id}.json
/r2/accounts_tttmp/{account_tttmp_id}.json
/r2/accounts_vlp/{account_vlp_id}.json
/r2/billing_customers/{account_id}.json
/r2/billing_invoices/{invoice_id}.json
/r2/billing_payment_intents/{event_id}.json
/r2/billing_payment_methods/{account_id}.json
/r2/billing_setup_intents/{event_id}.json
/r2/billing_subscriptions/{membership_id}.json
/r2/bookings/{booking_id}.json
/r2/memberships/{membership_id}.json
/r2/professionals/{professional_id}.json
/r2/profiles/{professional_id}.json
/r2/support_tickets/{ticket_id}.json
/r2/tokens/{account_id}.json
/r2/vlp_preferences/{account_id}.json
```

---

### Tax Monitor Pro (TMP)

TMP is the taxpayer discovery and membership platform. It does NOT own professional records.

Responsibilities: intake experience, tax pro directory discovery, taxpayer dashboard, inquiry capture and routing, discounts and entitlements.

Canonical storage (TMP-owned):

```
/r2/tmp_activity/{event_id}.json
/r2/tmp_entitlements/{account_id}.json
/r2/tmp_inquiries/{inquiry_id}.json
/r2/tmp_intake_sessions/{session_id}.json
/r2/tmp_preferences/{account_id}.json
```

---

### Transcript Tax Monitor (TTMP)

TTMP handles transcript diagnostics and analysis. It does NOT own professional records.

Responsibilities: transcript parser tool, diagnostic dashboard, report history, token consumption tracking.

Canonical storage (TTMP-owned):

```
/r2/ttmp_activity/{event_id}.json
/r2/ttmp_preferences/{account_id}.json
/r2/ttmp_transcript_jobs/{job_id}.json
/r2/ttmp_transcript_results/{result_id}.json
```

---

### Tax Tools Arcade (TTTMP)

TTTMP handles tax education games and tool execution. It does NOT own professional records.

Responsibilities: educational tax games, game analytics, tool execution state, usage telemetry, discovery traffic generation.

Canonical storage (TTTMP-owned):

```
/r2/tttmp_activity/{event_id}.json
/r2/tttmp_preferences/{account_id}.json
/r2/tttmp_tool_sessions/{session_id}.json
```

---

## Route Surface and Storage Map

### Canonical ID Reference

```
account_id        = ACCT_{UUID}
account_tmp_id    = TMP_ACCT_{account_id}
account_ttmp_id   = TTMP_ACCT_{account_id}
account_tttmp_id  = TTTMP_ACCT_{account_id}
account_vlp_id    = VLP_ACCT_{account_id}
booking_id        = BOOK_YYYYMMDD_{RANDOM}
event_id          = EVT_{UUID}
inquiry_id        = INQ_{UUID}
invoice_id        = INV_{UUID}
job_id            = JOB_{UUID}
membership_id     = MEM_{UUID}
message_id        = MSG_{UUID}
professional_id   = PRO_{UUID}
result_id         = RES_{UUID}
session_id        = SES_{UUID}
ticket_id         = TKT_{UUID}
```

IDs are globally unique and immutable once assigned.
